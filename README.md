# Encryption-and-Decryption1
Encryption is the process of converting plain, readable data into an unreadable format using an encryption algorithm and a secret key, ensuring confidentiality. Decryption is the reverse process, converting the encrypted data back into its original form using the same key, enabling authorized individuals to access the information securely.
